            The inspiration for this idea came from watching philosophy debates
            with celebrity New Agers.

            After sitting through hours of New Age rhetoric, I decided to have a
            crack at writing code to generate it automatically and speed things
            up a bit. I cobbled together a list of New Age buzzwords and cliché
            sentence patterns and this is the result.

            So, what is this for? Put it on your website as placeholder text.
            Print it out as a speech for your next affirmation circle and see if
            anyone can guess a computer wrote it. Use it to write the hottest
            new bestseller in the self-help section, or generate marketing copy
            for a new line of cheesecloth tunics or zero-point energy wands!

          <h3>Looking for the comments?</h3>
          <p>
            There used to be a Disqus comment section here, until I discovered
            that
            <a href="https://supunkavinda.blog/disqus"
              >their software is a cesspit of third-party tracking scripts</a
            >, and I respect your privacy more than that, so I got rid of it.

            The comments had been up since 2014, and like any public comment
            section, most of them were garbage — but here are a few favourites:

            There were the occasional commenters, both positive and negative,
            who thought that the generator was created to poke fun at New Agey
            people, or even spirituality in general. That's not the case at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason I made it was to demonstrate how easy it is to fool our
            brains with this fact-free, emotionally-charged language that tries
            to bypass our rational thinking. My hope was to encourage more
            skepticism of this kind of discourse, and of the many charlatans who
            use it to pervert the human desire for transcendence and take
            advantage of vulnerable people for personal gain.
