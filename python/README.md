This is a command line version of Seb Pearce's "New Age Bullshit Generator", see https://sebpearce.com/bullshit.

Converted to Python for use on the command line.  The program generates similar text to 
the Javascript version but instead of HTML output, text goes to stdout where it may be piped, 
saved, or used in another fashion.

Converted and contributed back under the MIT Licence by Kevin McQuiggin, mcquiggi@sfu.ca.
